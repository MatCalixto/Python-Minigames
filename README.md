# Python-Minigames
In here are some games I made with Python, they are simple and small but required quite the creativity to pull off.

Game List:

- TicTacToe: by far my favorite one, which also took the most time, two players go turns in playing a TicTacToe game, all normal TicTacToe rules apply.
- Guess Number: player has to guess a number which is anywhere between a minimum number, a maximum number while having a certain amount of chances to guess right, all of these numbers being asked for the player to input.
- Word Scramble: a random scrambled word is given to the player for him to unscramble, he is also given a theme and a hint.
- Squared: player is given a random number and is requested to enter either the square root of that number or that number squared.
